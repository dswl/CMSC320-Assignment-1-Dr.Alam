Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: We might consider using git as a form of version control. This way, when we develop programs, we have access to different versions of our codebase as we push changes to it.
Another reason we might consider using git is because multiple developers can work on the same codebase, making their separate branches and maximizing collaboration on a single working project.
One final reason we might consider using git is because it provides a way for us to back up our code. This, in case our code becomes inaccessible for whatever reason, it will still be backed on github.
