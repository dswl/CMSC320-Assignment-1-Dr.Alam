Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: We might consider using git as a form of version control. This way, when we develop programs, we have access to different versions of our codebase as we push changes to it.
Another reason we might consider using git is because multiple developers can work on the same codebase, making their separate branches and maximizing collaboration on a single working project.
One final reason we might consider using git is because it provides a way for us to back up our code. This, in case our code becomes inaccessible for whatever reason, it will still be backed on github.


Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: A field that data science can be applied to is advertising. For example, data science could be used to collect data on a certain marketing technique
and be used to draw conclusions. A website could track the number of people that click on a certain ad as opposed to another one for the same product.
Because of data science, conclusions can be draw about marketing techniques and what works the best for customers.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging is a nondestructive option of reconnecting branches to the main. Merging reconnects the branch with the main without destroying the history
of all other existing branches and the main. Rebasing is different because it moves the entire branch to the tip of the main branch. This means that
it will create new commits for every commit in the branch, thus rewriting the history of the project into one linear path.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I hope to improve my Python skills, especially with frameworks and technologies that I've never used before like Pandas. I also hope to improve my
data science methodologies and practices. I also hope to connect with more people in my class and form a meaningful network.
